Export videos
=======================================

This module allows the user to generate new videos with the annotations and the object's paths or contours directly drawn on the video.

------------------------
How to use
------------------------


| 1. Open the **"Modules"** tab and choose the **"Export Videos"** module.

.. note:: You can preview the generated video by clicking the video you selected and then clicking on the *'Play'* button under the video player

| 2. For each tab, choose the settings accordingly to what you want to include in the generated video:
|

Path
--------------------------------------

In this tab, the user should select the video over which the annotations and/or the paths will be drawn.

By checking the **"Draw paths"** checkbox, all the selected paths and contours will be drawn in the generated video.

Using the blue slider or the left and right textboxes, the user can also select a start and an end time for the video.
The video will then only be generated for the interval between the start and end time.

.. note :: 

	To change the start and end frame you also have to click on the name of the video, **not just the checkbox**

Circle
--------------------------------------

To use this tab, you must have selected a dataset(path or contour) in the PATH tab.

If a contour was selected in the previous tab, a circle will be drawn in the position of the object for the corresponding frame using the contour's area.

In case you select the checkbox **"Use a fixed size"**, which is mandatory if the selected dataset is a path, a circle with a fixed size will be drawn every frame over the object's position. Use the slider to change the size of the circle.

Circle color
--------------------------------------

If any dataset is selected, the drawn circle will use the color of this dataset for each frame.
If instead the checkbox **"Use a fixed color"** is selected, the drawn circle will use the chosen color.
To change the color, simply change the numbers, beware it is in the BGR format (0-255).

Background
--------------------------------------

If any image is selected, the video will be generated with the image in the background instead of the frames of the video.

Draw events
--------------------------------------

Select the events to be drawn in the exported video.
If the **"Draw titles"** checkbox is select, the titles of the events will be also drawn.

Split files by events
--------------------------------------

| In this tab, the user can select to only generate the video during certain moments.
| If no events are selected, the whole video will be generated. If one or more events are selected, the video will only be generated during those events.
| The generated video will also be split in multiple videos, where each video will correspond to one of the selected events.

|
| 3. Choose the directory you want to save the video in by clicking the **"Open"** button on the bottom right side and then write the name you want the video to have in the **"Output file name"** textbox.
|
| 4. Click the **"Export Video(s)"** button to generate the video.
|
