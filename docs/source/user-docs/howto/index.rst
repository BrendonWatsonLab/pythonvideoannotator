---------------
Project
---------------

By default the application opens with an empty project so you can start adding videos immediately.




Open a project
===============

To open a existing project select the option **"Open"** in the **"File"** menu of the main window.
A new window will appear asking for the project folder. You should select the folder and press open.

.. seealso:: Find information about the project folders structure in the :ref:`Project tree <projecttree-label>` section.

Save a project
===============

It is possible to save a project by using the options **"Save"** or **"Save as"** in the **"File"** menu of the main window.

Save
-------------

Update the current project files with the last changes.

.. note:: If you are saving the project for the first time, this option will behave like the **"Save as"** option.

Save as
-------------

Save or export the current project into a folder.

.. note:: The user should choose an empty directory to avoid mixing the project files with pre existing files and directories.


Add a video
===============

Video
---------------

You can right click a video to be able to add objects, geomtries, notes and images to it. You can also capture the current frame or remove the video.

.. _addgeometry-label:

Add & edit a geometry
==============================

A geometry is used to define a region or a static object in the video. The geometries created will be displayed on top of the video. To edit a geometry, simply click on the **"Edit"** button on the right side of the window.

Drawing geometries
------------------------

To draw a geometry, you should first select the type of geometry you would like to draw (Square or Cicle). Then, simply drag the mouse over the video to draw the polygon. You can zoom in and out using the mouse wheel.

The **polygon points can be moved**, by dragging and dropping the selected point, or **deleted** by pressing the delete key on the keyboard. Once you're done, press **"Apply"** to confirm your changes.

.. _captureframe-label:

Capture a frame
===============

The next step can be used to capture the current frame into an image.

.. _add_objects-label:

Add an object
===============

An object is something in the video whose properties change over time.

.. _add_dataset-label:

Add a dataset
------------------------

A dataset is an object's property that changes over time. There are 3 types of properties that you can add: **Paths**, **Countours** or **Values**.

.. seealso:: Find more information about the datasets in the :ref:`Objectsâ€™ datasets <datasets-label>` section.

To add a dataset right click over the object and select one of the available options.

.. image:: /_static/howto/add-datasets.png

Path
-----------

A path dataset stores information about an object's path.

Contours
-----------

A contours dataset stores information about the object' contour over time, but it also has information about the object's path.

Value
-----------

This property stores any arbitrary number that can change over time. It can be used to store external data like for example hardware triggers.


* 	**Import data from a CSV file**

	|

	Right click over the value object in the project tree, and select the option **import**.

	.. image:: /_static/howto/import-value-from-csvfile-step1.png

	|

	Choose the file, remove the file header (if it exists) using the starting row field and select the separator character.
	You will see a preview of the parsing of the file to import.

	Then select the column corresponding to the number of the frame and to the value you would like to import. If the field **Frame** has the value -1 then it will be considered that the row number N corresponds to the N frame.
