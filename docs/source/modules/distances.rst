Distances
==================================

This module calculates the distances between two objects, using their paths or contours.

------------------------
How to use
------------------------

| 1. Open the **"Modules"** tab and choose the **"Distances"** module.
| 
| 2. **Check** the corresponding checkboxes to select the **video**, the **two objects** and the **paths/contours of the two objects** between which the distance will be calculated.
|
| 3. Use the **blue slider or the left and right textboxes** to **set a start and an end frame** for the calculation. The distance will only be calculated for the interval you choose.

.. note :: 

	To change the start and end frame you also have to click on the name of the video, **not just the checkbox**

| 4. Press the **"Apply"** button and you're done.
|

------------------------
Result
------------------------

The calculated distance will appear under one of the two objects as a new value called: **"distance-between(...)".**
