Path map
===============================

This module maps the path of an object.

------------------------
How to use
------------------------

| 1. Open the **"Modules"** tab and choose the **"Path map"** module.
| 
| 2. **Check** the corresponding checkboxes to select the **video**, the **object** and the **path/contour** for which you want to calculate a pathmap.
|
| 3. Use the **blue slider or the left and right textboxes** to **set a start and an end frame** for the calculation. The pathmap will only be calculated for the interval you choose.

.. note :: 

	To change the start and end frame you also have to click on the name of the video, **not just the checkbox**

| 4. Use the **"Radius"** slider to set the radius size for the object. A bigger radius has a bigger impact in the pathmap. Try different sizes for the radius until you're happy with the resulting pathmap.
|
| 5. Press the **"Apply"** button and you're done.
|

------------------------
Result
------------------------

| The calculated pathmap will be added to the video as a new image called **"pathmap-1"**.
